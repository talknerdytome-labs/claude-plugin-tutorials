Create a {{ platform }} post about {{ topic }}.

## Platform Guidelines

### Twitter/X
- Max 280 characters
- Punchy, conversational tone
- Use line breaks for readability
- Hashtags: 1-2 max, only if relevant
- Hook in first line

### LinkedIn
- 1300 characters ideal (can go to 3000)
- Professional but human
- Start with a bold statement or question
- Use line breaks generously
- End with a question to drive engagement
- Hashtags: 3-5 at the end

### Instagram
- 2200 character limit
- Storytelling format works well
- Emojis are welcome (but don't overdo it)
- Hashtags: up to 30, but 5-10 quality ones is better
- Include a call to action

### Threads
- 500 characters per post
- Conversational, like Twitter but longer
- Can create thread sequences
- No hashtags needed
- Casual, authentic voice

## General Rules
- Follow our brand voice guidelines
- Hook in the first line - make people stop scrolling
- One clear message per post
- End with engagement driver (question, CTA, or thought-provoking statement)
- No clickbait - deliver on what you promise

Now write the post. Provide the final copy ready to paste, plus a brief note on why you made the choices you did.
