- Helpful and approachable
- Enthusiastic without being over-the-top

## STYLE
- Short sentences (aim for under 20 words)
- Active voice, not passive
- No jargon unless you explain it
- Use contractions (we're, you'll, it's)
- Break up long paragraphs

## WORDS WE USE
- "You" not "users" or "customers"
- "Simple" not "easy" or "seamless"
- "Help" not "enable" or "empower"
- "Build" not "create" or "craft"
- "Show" not "demonstrate" or "illustrate"

## WORDS WE AVOID
- "Synergy"
- "Leverage"
- "Circle back"
- "Touch base"
- "Holistic"
- "Cutting-edge"
- "Best-in-class"

## FORMATTING
- Use bullet points for lists of 3+ items
- Bold key points sparingly
- Include a clear call to action when appropriate
